### Welcome to my ft_services repository 👋

⭐️ The goal of this subject was to discover Kubernetes and set up a cluster with several simple services (Wordpress, Phpmyadmin, Nginx, MySQL, Grafana, InfluxDB, FTPS server). Each service runs in a dedicated container built under Linux Alpine.

## 💡 Usage

You first need to install minikube on your system ! Please refer to documentation : <br>
https://kubernetes.io/fr/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/

Then simply :

```
./setup.sh
```

You can now browser through your different services.<br>
